= Requirements =

The Pronamic Pay plugin extends WordPress extensions with payment methods such as iDEAL, Bancontact, Sofort and credit cards. To offer the payment methods to the visitors of your WordPress website you also require one of these e-commerce or form builder extensions.

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of Pronamic Pay, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type “Pronamic Pay” and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found the plugin you can view details about it such as the the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking “Install Now”.

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading the plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

= Updating =

Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.
