= Requirements =

The Pronamic iDEAL plugin extends WordPress extensions with the iDEAL 
payment method. To offer the iDEAL payment method to the vistors of
your WordPress website you also require one of these extensions. Normally
this is an e-commerce or forms plugin. 

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file 
transfers itself and you don’t need to leave your web browser. To do an 
automatic install of Pronamic iDEAL, log in to your WordPress dashboard, 
navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type “Pronamic iDEAL” and click Search Plugins. Once 
you’ve found our iDEAL plugin you can view details about it such as the the 
point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can 
install it by simply clicking “Install Now”.

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading our iDEAL plugin and 
uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application. 
The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

= Updating =

Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you 
backup your site just in case.
