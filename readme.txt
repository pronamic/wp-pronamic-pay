== Installation ==

= Requirements =

The Pronamic Pay plugin extends WordPress extensions with payment methods such as iDEAL, Bancontact, Sofort and credit cards. To offer the payment methods to the visitors of your WordPress website you also require one of these e-commerce or form builder extensions.

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don‚Äôt need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of Pronamic Pay, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type ‚ÄúPronamic Pay‚Äù and click Search Plugins. Once you‚Äôve found the plugin you can view details about it such as the the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking ‚ÄúInstall Now‚Äù.

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading the plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

= Updating =

Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.

= 9.4.5 =
### Changed

- üì£ Mollie payment methods that can be used as a first payment for recurring
  payments are marked with support for recurring payments. For extensions such
  as WooCommerce Subscriptions, MemberPress and Restrict Content Pro, this may
  mean that payment methods such as Bancontact, Belfius, EPS, Giropay, iDEAL,
  KBC and Sofort can now also be visible when paying for subscriptions. Where
  previously the "Direct Debit (mandate via iDEAL)" payment method/gateway had
  to be used, the regular iDEAL payment method/gateway can now also be used.
