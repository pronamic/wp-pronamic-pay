== Installation ==

= Requirements =

The Pronamic Pay plugin extends WordPress extensions with the iDEAL payment method. To offer the iDEAL payment method to the vistors of your WordPress website you also require one of these extensions. Normally this is an e-commerce or forms plugin. 

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of Pronamic iDEAL, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type “Pronamic iDEAL” and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found our iDEAL plugin you can view details about it such as the the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking “Install Now”.

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading our iDEAL plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

= Updating =

Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.

== Are there any known plugin conflicts? ==

Unfortunately WordPress is notorious for conflicts between themes and plugins. It is unavoidable as you have no control over what other plugins and themes do. While we do take steps to avoid conflicts as best we can, we have no control over other plugins or themes.

As conflicts are found we will update this list. If you discover a conflict with a another plugin, please notify us.

Here is a list of known plugin conflicts:

=== WPML ===

The [WPML](https://wpml.org/) plugin(s) can conflict with multiple gateways. A lot of the gateways use `home_url( '/' )` to retrieve the WordPress home URL. The WPML plugins hooks in to this function to change the home URL to the correct language URL. This can result in incorrect checksums, signatures and hashes.

=== WordPress HTTPS ===

The [WordPress HTTPS](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-https/) can conflict with the OmniKassa payment method. It can cause invalid signature errors. The WordPress HTTPS plugin parses the complete output of an WordPress website and changes 'http' URLs to 'https' URLs, this  results in OmniKassa data that no longer matches the signature.
